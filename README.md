# Contributing
Contributions are greatly appreciated. If you find a bug please consider creating an issue for it. To be treated fast consider adding a test case in the spec file in order to reproduce it. Please fork this repository and open a pull request to add snippets, make grammar tweaks, etc.
## Todo
1. Add test cases to the project.
2. Fully support template strings _(only half-supported from lexer and parser side)_.
3. Support Arrays _(It would be nice to design a generic Iteration Protocol to be used with strings, objects, etc.)_
4. Support functions, closures and dynamic binding.
5. Support objects, this and other implementation details.
6. Enrich Pencil environment with built-in functions and objects.
