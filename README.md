## Todo
1. Fully support template strings _(only half-supported from lexer and parser side)_.
2. Support Arrays _(It would be nice to design a generic Iteration Protocol to be used with strings, objects, etc.)_
3. Support functions, closures and dynamic binding.
4. Support objects, this and other implementation details.
5. Enrich Pencil environment with built-in functions and objects.
